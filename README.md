# Risk Analytics in Banking and Financial Services using Power BI

## Problem Statement

Develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers. In the financial services sector, companies face numerous risks, including credit risk, market risk, and compliance risks. This project addresses the critical need for effective risk management in lending processes.

## Solution

We provide interactive dashboards created using the latest Power BI tools to help lending companies make data-driven decisions. These dashboards analyze applicant profiles to predict loan repayment likelihood, enabling informed decisions on loan approvals, and adjust lending strategy. By visualizing key risk indicators, banks can evaluate their exposure to different risks in real-time.

## Key Features

*   **Applicant Profiling:** Comprehensive analysis of applicant data to assess creditworthiness..
*   **Risk Visualization:** Interactive dashboards displaying key risk indicators and potential trouble spots.
*   **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Empowers informed decisions on loan approvals based on data insights.
*   **Proactive Risk Mitigation:** Helps anticipate loan defaults, fraud attempts, and market changes.

## About Dataset

This dataset contains information about bank details and various client details, consisting of multiple interlinked tables through primary and foreign keys. The tables include:

*   Banking Relationship
*   Client-Banking
*   Gender

## Conclusion

Empowered by the latest data visualization techniques, Power BI dashboards are among the most effective resources for use in the banking sector. A banking operations dashboard in Power BI can be developed with key banking-related metrics and KPIs. These dashboards demonstrate how diverse approaches can generate powerful insights from the same dataset.
## Future Work

With these dashboards, banks can easily determine the total loan amount and other relevant information for a particular investor. The dashboards also provide insights into:

*   Which types of banks have a higher number of clients (e.g., private banks).
*   Strategies for other banks to increase their client base.
*   Which nationality has the highest bank loans.
*   Various types of amounts involved in different types of accounts by investors.
